# DayPlanner

This dayplanner is designed so that the user can plan their tasks by hour.  As the day goes on, the color of the background for each hour block will change.  Once the hour is in the past, it will then turn grey and be at 50% oppacity.  Localstorage is used, so anything that is saved will be there when the user comes back later in the day.
